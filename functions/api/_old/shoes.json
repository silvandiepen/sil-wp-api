			"description": "Chuck Taylor All-Stars or Converse All Stars (also referred to as \"Converse\", \"Chuck Taylors\", \"Chucks\", \"Cons\", and \"All Stars\") is a model of casual shoe manufactured by Converse (a subsidiary of Nike, Inc. since 2003) that was initially developed as a basketball shoe in the early 20th century. The design of the Chuck Taylor All Star has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s. The shoe consists of a stitched upper portion, a toe cap that is usually made of white rubber, and a sole that is usually made of brown rubber. Although Chuck Taylors are made of various materials such as leather, the original and most widely known version of the shoe is made from cotton canvas. The innovative detail of the original shoe was the \"loose lining\" of soft canvas that was intended to provide flexibility and prevent blisters.\n\nThe Chuck Taylor II, an improved model, was announced by company management in July 2015. Incorporating Nike technology, it retains the outward appearance of the original shoe while employing a full-length Lunarlon insole.",
